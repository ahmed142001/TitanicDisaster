# TitanicDisaster
 The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups  of people were more likely to survive than others. So,I built a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more  likely to survive?” using passengers’ data (ie age, gender, etc)
